# TCTChatLog_GCX

Google Apps Script project for the Spigen GCX TCT (Third-party Channel Team) chat log sheet. Sends escalation alerts to Google Chat when a row status changes to `Esc T2`, sends daily close reports, and manages dropdown validation on log sheets.

## Escalation alert flow (`chat_alrt_main.js`)

1. `onEdit` fires on any edit in rows 5+ of `Lazada log` or `Shopee log`
2. If **col A** changes to `Esc T2` and hasn't been sent before (deduped by `SENT_IDS` in Script Properties):
   - Collects all other `Esc T2` rows on the same sheet
   - Posts a Google Chat card with buttons linking to each row
3. Routes to the correct webhook based on sheet name + platform value in **col E**:
   - `Lazada log` + `Lazada` → `WEBHOOK_LAZADA`
   - `Shopee log` + `Shopee` → `WEBHOOK_SHOPEE`
4. A row is only recorded in `SENT_IDS` if a message actually went out (sheet name/platform
   matched); a mismatch no longer silently swallows the row.

Current header layout (row 4): `A Status | B Ticket ID | C Order ID | D Date | E Platform | ...`.
Column D used to be Platform until a `Date` column was inserted before it — if alerts stop firing
again, re-check this layout first with `sheet.getRange(4, 1, 1, 16).getValues()`.
`WEBHOOK_TEST` (unused by the live flow) exists for manually verifying payload delivery — see
`testSendEscT2ToTestWebhook()`.

## Daily summary (`send_daily_stat.js`)

Triggered by time-based trigger — posts a `TCT Chat Log_GCX 마감보고` card to Google Chat with counts of `Esc T2` rows across all log sheets and sheet-link buttons.

## Deployment

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/GCX/TCTChatLog_GCX
clasp push --force
```

Set a daily time-based trigger on the summary function in the GAS editor.
